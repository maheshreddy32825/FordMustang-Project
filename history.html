    <h5>First generation (1965 To 1973)</h5>
    <img src="Images/pic9.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
<span>
<p>The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March 1964 until 1973. The introduction of the Mustang created a new class of automobile known as the pony car. The Mustangs styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host of imitators.

It was initially introduced as a hardtop and convertible with the fastback version put on sale in August 1965. At the time of its introduction, the Mustang, sharing its underpinnings with the Falcon, was slotted into a compact car segment.

With each revision, the Mustang saw an increase in overall dimensions and in engine power. The 1971 model saw a drastic redesign to its predecessors. After an initial surge, sales were steadily declining, as Ford began working on a new generation Mustang. With the onset of the 1973 oil crisis, Ford was prepared, having already designed the smaller Mustang II for the 1974 model year. This new car had no common components with preceding models.</p>

<p>The second-generation Ford Mustang is a pony car that was manufactured by Ford from 1973 until 1978. It was introduced in showrooms during September 1973, in coupe and hatchback versions for the 1974 model year, in time for the 1973 oil crisis. The Mustang II had no common components with the preceding models and shared its platform with the subcompact-sized Ford Pinto.</p>

    <h5>Third generation (1979 To 1993)</h5>
    <img src="Images/pic11.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
<span>
<p>The third-generation Mustang was produced by Ford from 1978 to 1993. Built on Fords Fox platform (and is thus commonly referred to as the "Fox" Mustang), it evolved through a number of sub-models, trim levels, and drivetrain combinations during its production life. It underwent updates for 1987, and for a time seemed destined for replacement with a front wheel drive Mazda platform before company executives were swayed by consumer opinions. Enthusiasts group the generation into two segments: the 1979-1986 cars, with their quad headlight arrangement, and the 1987-1993 cars, with their aero composite headlamped front fascia styling. Production ended with the introduction of the fourth-generation Mustang (SN-95) for the 1994 model year.</p>

    <h5>Fourth generation (1994 To 2004)</h5>

<span>
<p>For the 1994 model year, the Ford Mustang underwent its first major redesign in fifteen years. The design, code named "SN-95" by Ford, was based on an updated version of the Fox platform. It featured styling by Bud Magaldi that incorporated some stylistic elements from the classic Mustangs. A convertible returned, but the notchback and hatchback body styles used in earlier Mustangs were not available.

Prior to the redesigned Mustang's launch, a two-seater show car was designed by Darrell Behmer and Bud Magali. Called the Mustang Mach III, it was shown at the 1993 North American International Auto Show in Detroit and hinted at what the new production Mustang would look like. The Mach III featured a supercharged 4.6 L DOHC V8 with 450 hp (336 kW; 456 PS). While this engine was not put into production, it hinted to the future use of Ford's Modular V8 in the Mustang, including the eventual use of a supercharged 4.6 L V8.</p>

    <h5>Fifth generation (2005 To 2014)</h5>
    <img src="Images/pic13.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
<span>
<p>The fifth-generation Ford Mustang is a pony car that was manufactured by Ford from 2004 to 2014, at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. The fifth generation began with the 2005 model year, and received a facelift for the 2010 model year. Originally designed by Sid Ramnarace through late 2001 and finalized in mid-2002, the fifth-generation Mustang's design was previewed by two preproduction concept cars that debuted at the 2003 North American International Auto Show. Development began on the S-197 program in 1999 under chief engineer Hau Thai-Tang, shortly after the 1998 launch of "New Edge" SN-95 facelift. From the second half of 1999, design work commenced under Ford design chief, J Mays, and concluded in July 2002 with the design freeze.[1][2] There have been several variants of the fifth-generation Ford Mustang that include the Mustang GT/California Special, Shelby Mustang, Bullitt Mustang, and Boss 302 Mustang.</p>

    <h5>Sixth generation (2015 To present)</h5>
    <img src="Images/pic14.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
<span>
<p>The sixth generation Ford Mustang also known as the "Mustang II", is the current iteration of the Mustang pony car manufactured by Ford. The sixth generation was presented at private Ford events on December 5, 2013 and commenced series production at the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant on July 14, 2014. In departure from prior Mustang models, the sixth generation Mustang includes fully independent rear suspension on all models, as well as an optional 2.3L EcoBoost turbocharged and direct injected four cylinder engine. The new Mustang was introduced as a 2015 model year vehicle, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Ford Mustang, which was revealed as a 1965 model year vehicle on April 17, 1964.

The sixth generation is also the first Ford Mustang to be marketed and sold globally, and represented the first time that factory right hand drive Mustangs were produced in addition to the left hand drive models. This is part of the "One Ford" business plan, which also applies to the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, Ford Mondeo, Escape, Ford Kuga, Edge, Ford Transit Connect, Ford Transit, as well as other models.</p>
